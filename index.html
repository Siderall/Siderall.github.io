        <p>A skilled GIS Specialist in industry ‘best practice’ approaches confident in working with many different types of data and in multi-disciplinary environments. Proficient in office settings as well as field collection scenarios. Effective visual representation and communication of data is the ultimate goal, but intelligent spatial modeling and analysis is the process, and solid database construction is the foundation. </p>
        <p>I am self-motivated, organized and personable. Working in a team that is focused on a larger mission is exactly where I want to be. I have four and a half years of experience as a Geo-spatial Data Specialist working for the non-profit organization Global Heritage Fund that sought to protect endangered Cultural Heritage Sites in the developing world. I was involved in many aspects of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in this position: GPS data acquisition in the field, high-quality cartography using Adobe Illustrator, spatial analysis in ESRI ArcGIS, geo-referencing of CAD archaeological site plan data and database management, to name a few. My attention to detail was a valuable skill I developed in this role, and I got great satisfaction from producing analysis that had big impacts on the understanding of important issues facing the organization.</p>
